An R Markdown template using [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and [`papaja`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) to create reproducible scientific manuscripts in Microsoft Word

Reproducible scientific manuscripts
===================================

## R Markdown and manuscripts

Of the many great resources for creating reproducible documents in R Markdown, two packages stand out: [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and [`papaja`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja).
`bookdown` is a flexible tool not only for creating books, but also documents of any kind that include cross-referencing.
`papaja` is specifically designed for APA formatting, which is used in my field.

I wanted to combine the strengths of both packages into a flexible template.
Specifically, I wanted to create Microsoft Word documents using R Markdown that (a) already had the formatting I needed without a lot of post-output effort and (b) were also easily customized depending on the journal/audience.

While many journals accept LaTeX submissions, my collaborators typically rely on a Word-based workflow.
Converting existing templates from .tex files to Word produced less than satisfactory results.
Existing templates for Word output were also not formatted for my needs and were not easily customized.

## The template

I developed [this template](https://github.com/hollzzar/manuscript-template) for creating scientific manuscripts to take advantage of R Markdown's reproducibility, Word's ease of collaboration, and `bookdown`'s cross-referencing capabilities.

### Organization

The R Markdown files and R scripts for the template are organized in a very hierarchical fashion.
This structure keeps the information tidy and concise at each stage, from data wrangling, analysis, and visualization to presentation/writing.

There are separate R Markdown files for each section:

- Title page
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusion/discussion
- Acknowledgments/funding

There is more information about using [`child` documents](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/organization.html#child-documents) and [source code](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/organization.html#source) in my [R Markdown Guide](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/).

### Formatting

The formatting can be easily customized by changing the [Word document template](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/template.html#word-1) file or editing the [fenced code blocks](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#fenced-code-blocks) in the Title page, Abstract, and Acknowledgments/funding files.

The Word document template (*template.docx*) tells Pandoc how to convert from markdown text to Word output.
Pandoc uses the text-specific information---for example, *Header 1* in the image below---to apply different formats to the output.

```{r template_word, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/template_word.png")
```

In order to edit these formats:

1. Open the template document
1. Open the *Styles Pane*
1. Highlight the text whose format you want to change
1. Make the desired changes (e.g., italicizing *Header 1*)
1. Locate the format in the *Styles Pane*
1. Select *Update to Match Selection* from the drop-down menu

Pandoc automatically assigns particular types of text to particular Word formats.
For example, first level headers in R Markdown (`\# Some header`) receive the *Header 1* format in Word.
If you want to specify exactly which Word format the text should receive, you can use fenced code blocks.
Below, I specify that I want the *Abstract text* format that I defined in my Word template to apply to the text between the three colons.

```

# Abstract {-}

::: {custom-style="Abstract text"}
Your abstract goes here.

```

## Limitations

There are two main limitations to using Word outputs. 
One is that, to my knowledge, there is no way to include line numbers or update headers automatically.
This will need to be done in the Word document output.

More importantly, there is currently no way easy way to incorporate track-changes from collaborators.
I recommend using Git to compare your document to your collaborators' or using the *combine documents* functionality in Word.
Unfortunately, neither of these solutions updates your actual R Markdown documents.
This will need to be done by hand.
