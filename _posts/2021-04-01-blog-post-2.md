An [R Markdown template](https://github.com/hollzzar/manuscript-template) for creating reproducible scientific manuscripts in Microsoft Word

Reproducible scientific manuscripts
===================================

## R Markdown and manuscripts

Of the many great resources for creating reproducible documents in R Markdown, two packages stand out: [`bookdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and [`papaja`](https://github.com/crsh/papaja).
`bookdown` is a powerful tool for creating not only books, but also other documents needing cross-referencing of tables, figures, and sections/chapters.
`papaja` is specifically designed for APA-formatted documents.

Although many researchers rely on Word-based work flows, I found the existing resources for combining R Markdown and Microsoft Word to be limited.
The documentation for `bookdown` is clear and thorough, but privileges the more flexible and easily customized HTML and PDF outputs over Word outputs.
`papaja` also privileges PDF over Word outputs in its documentation and functionality.
As a result, these packages fall short of providing the flexible and customizable Word outputs needed for writing scientific manuscripts.
The work-around approach---creating PDF outputs and converting the underlying .tex files to Word with Pandoc---also produces less than satisfactory results.

I wanted to create Microsoft Word documents using R Markdown that (a) already had the formatting I needed without a lot of post-output effort and (b) were also easily customized depending on the journal/audience.
Thus, I combined the strengths of `bookdown` and `papaja` into the flexible template described below.

## The template

I developed [this template](https://github.com/hollzzar/manuscript-template) for creating scientific manuscripts to take advantage of R Markdown's reproducibility, Word's ease of collaboration, and `bookdown`'s cross-referencing capabilities.

### Organization

The R Markdown files and R scripts for the template are organized in a hierarchical fashion.
This structure keeps the information tidy and concise at each stage, from data wrangling, analysis, and visualization to presentation/writing.

There are separate R Markdown files for each section:

- Title page
- Abstract
- Introduction
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusion/discussion
- Acknowledgments/funding

There is more information about using [`child` documents](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/organization.html#child-documents) and [source code](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/organization.html#source) in my [R Markdown Guide](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/).

### Formatting

The formatting can be easily customized by changing the [Word document template](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/template.html#word-1) file or editing the [fenced code blocks](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#fenced-code-blocks) in the Title page, Abstract, and Acknowledgments/funding files.

The Word document template (*template.docx*) tells Pandoc how to convert from markdown text to Word output.
Pandoc uses the text-specific information---for example, *Header 1* in the image below---to apply different formats to the output.

In order to edit these formats:

1. Open the template document
1. Open the *Styles Pane*
1. Highlight the text whose format you want to change
1. Make the desired changes (e.g., italicizing *Header 1*)
1. Locate the format in the *Styles Pane*
1. Select *Update to Match Selection* from the drop-down menu

Pandoc automatically assigns particular types of text to particular Word formats.
For example, first level headers in R Markdown (e.g., `# Some header`) receive the *Header 1* format in Word.
If you want to specify exactly which Word format the text should receive, you can use fenced code blocks.
Below, I specify that I want the *Abstract text* format that I defined in my Word template to apply to the text between the three colons.

```

# Abstract {-}

::: {custom-style="Abstract text"}
Your abstract goes here.

```

## Limitations

There are two main limitations to using Word outputs. 
One is that, to my knowledge, there is no way to include line numbers or update headers automatically.
This will need to be done in the Word document output.

More importantly, there is currently no way easy way to incorporate track-changes from collaborators.
I recommend using Git to compare your document to your collaborators' or using the *combine documents* functionality in Word.
Unfortunately, neither of these solutions updates your actual R Markdown documents.
This will need to be done by hand.
