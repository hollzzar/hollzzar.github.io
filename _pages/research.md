What is the difference between a dialect and a language? This question drives my interests in adaptation to syntactic, phonological, and phonetic variation; language, register, and dialect switching; mapping lexicons in contact; and quantifying cross-variety distance. To date, my lines of research investigating bidialectalism and bilingualism have developed separately, but future work will integrate these foci.

## Variation

My primary line of research focuses on processing dialectal variation in syntax. My Master's thesis, and subsequent manuscript (to appear), investigated the influences of familiarity and (perceptions of) standardness on the comprehension of Southern United States English. Standardness drove ERP responses, but familiarity drove acceptability and intelligibility judgments. Post-COVID, I plan to bring our mobile EEG system to Southern communities to understand the impacts of immersion and active dialect use on processing.

## Switching

I am currently working on a language switching project with my adviser, Janet van Hell; Navin Viswanathan (Communication Sciences and Disorders); and Sarah Paterno, a research assistant in the BiLD Lab. We designed a series of online behavioral studies to investigate intra-sentential Spanish-English code-switching detection and comprehension in noise. We will also investigate the effects of pre-switch acoustic-phonetic features in a future EEG study.

## Contact

I received an NSF-funded Partnerships for International Research and Education Fellowship, postponed until 2022 due to COVID-19, to conduct field research with John Lipski (Spanish and Linguistics) on the northern coast of Colombia. My project will translate lab-based methods---including lexical decision, word association, and network science---to an *in situ* study of bilingual language control in Palenquero-Spanish (creole-lexifier) speakers.

## Distance

Typological distance affects a variety of linguistic behaviors, including code-switching production, language learning, and online comprehension in bilinguals. I am interested in using network science to quantify the (dis)similarity between different language varieties. I recently wrote an opinion piece (to appear) with Lizz Karuza (Psychology) to advocate for the use of multiplex methods in psycholinguistics.
