## Variation

My Master's thesis, and [subsequent manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2021.104949), investigated the influences of familiarity and (perceptions of) standardness on the comprehension of Southern United States English. Standardness drove ERP responses, while familiarity drove acceptability and intelligibility judgments. This summer, I plan to bring our mobile EEG system to Southern communities to understand the impacts of immersion and active dialect use on processing.

## Switching

I am currently working on a language switching project with my adviser, Janet van Hell; Navin Viswanathan (Communication Sciences and Disorders); and Sarah Paterno and Victoria Medina, research assistants in the BiLD Lab. We designed a series of online behavioral studies to investigate intra-sentential Spanish-English code-switching detection and comprehension in noise. We will also investigate the effects of pre-switch acoustic-phonetic features in an EEG study.

## Contact

I received an NSF-funded Partnerships for International Research and Education Fellowship, postponed until 2022 due to COVID-19, to conduct field research with John Lipski (Spanish and Linguistics) on the northern coast of Colombia. My project will translate lab-based methods---including lexical decision, word association, and network science---to an *in situ* study of bilingual language control in Palenquero-Spanish (creole-lexifier) speakers.

## Distance

Typological distance affects a variety of linguistic behaviors, including code-switching production, language learning, and online comprehension in bilinguals. I am interested in using network science to quantify the (dis)similarity between different language varieties. Lizz Karuza (Psychology) and I published an [opinion piece](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bandl.2021.104977) to advocate for the use of multiplex methods in psycholinguistics.
