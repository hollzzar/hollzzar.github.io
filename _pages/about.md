I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Language and Brain Lab at the University of Connecticut (PI: Dr. Emily Myers). I use a combination of neuroimaging (fMRI), neuromodulation (TMS), and behavioral methods (including eye-tracking) to study how right and left temporal regions contribute to speech perception. The goal is to understand how therapeutic interventions might recruit these brain areas in the successful remediation of stroke. Overall, I am interested in how the perceptual system adapts to variation and change.
 
Before coming to UConn, I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology and Language Science, with a Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, at The Pennsylvania State University. As a graduate student in the Bilingualism and Linguistic Diversity Lab (PI: Dr. Janet van Hell), I used neuropsychological (EEG) and behavioral methods to understand how cognitive, linguistic, and social factors interact during language processing. I earned my M.S. in Psychology from The Pennsylvania State University in 2020 and my B.A. in Psychology, with a minor in Linguistics, from The University of Chicago in 2015. In between my undergraduate and graduate studies, I worked as a financial analyst supporting fair lending and language access initiatives at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). 

In addition to my main research agenda, I also enjoy learning new coding and software skills. My [R Markdown Guide for Psychology Graduate Students](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/) and resources for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization in R and MATLAB on [my GitHub](https://github.com/hollzzar) are available for similarly interested researchers. Outside the lab, I love to cook, knit, play volleyball, and snuggle with my greyhound, [Zuko](/images/zuko.jpeg).
