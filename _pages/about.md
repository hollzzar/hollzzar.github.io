I work with Dr. Janet G. van Hell in the [Bilingualism and Language Development (BiLD) Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/bildlab/) at The Pennsylvania State University, where I primarily study the comprehension of dialectal variation and code-switching with neuropsychological (EEG) and behavioral methods. I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu/graduate/program-areas/cognitive) and affiliated with the [Center for Language Science](https://cls.la.psu.edu/).

# Research

What is the difference between a dialect and a language? This question drives my interests in adaptation to syntactic, phonological, and phonetic variation; language, register, and dialect switching; processing accented speech; mapping lexicons in contact; and quantifying cross-variety distance.
