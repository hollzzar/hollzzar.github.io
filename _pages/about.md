I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu/graduate/program-areas/cognitive) and affiliated with the [Center for Language Science](https://cls.la.psu.edu/) at The Pennsylvania State University. I work with Dr. Janet G. van Hell in the [Bilingualism and Development (BiLD) Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/bildlab/), where I primarily study the comprehension of dialectal variation and code-switching.
