I am pursuing a dual title PhD in Psychology and Language Science, with a Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, at Penn State. I am in the Cognitive Area of the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.la.psu.edu/graduate/program-areas/cognitive) and affiliated with the [Center for Language Science](https://cls.la.psu.edu/).

I work with Janet van Hell in the [Bilingualism and Language Development (BiLD) Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/bildlab/) at Penn State, where I primarily study the comprehension of dialectal variation and code-switching with neuropsychological (EEG) and behavioral methods.
