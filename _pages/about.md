I am a graduate student in Janet van Hell's [Bilingualism and Language Development Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/bildlab/), where I primarily study the comprehension of dialectal variation and code-switching. I use neuropsychological (EEG) and behavioral methods to understand how cognitive, linguistic, and social factors interact during language processing. The [research](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/research/) and [publications](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/publications/) pages detail my past work, current interests, and future directions.

In addition to my main research agenda, I also enjoy learning new coding and software skills. You can read my [posts](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/year-archive/) on data wrangling, analysis, and visualization in R and MATLAB and my [R Markdown Guide for Psychology Graduate Students](https://www.hzaharchuk.com/rmarkdown-guide/). Outside the lab, I love to cook, knit, play volleyball, and snuggle with my greyhound, [Zuko](/images/zuko.jpeg).

I began my dual title Ph.D. in Psychology and Language Science, with a Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, at The Pennsylvania State University in 2018. I am in the [Cognitive Area](https://psych.la.psu.edu/graduate/program-areas/cognitive) of the Department of Psychology and affiliated with the [Center for Language Science](https://cls.la.psu.edu/).

I earned my M.S. in Psychology from The Pennsylvania State University in 2020 and my B.A. in Psychology, with a minor in Linguistics, from The University of Chicago in 2015. In between, I worked as a financial analyst supporting fair lending and language access initiatives at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).
