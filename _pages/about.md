I began my dual title PhD in Psychology and Language Science, with a Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, at The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in 2018. I am in the [Cognitive Area](https://psych.la.psu.edu/graduate/program-areas/cognitive) of the Department of Psychology and affiliated with the [Center for Language Science](https://cls.la.psu.edu/).

I work with Janet van Hell in the [Bilingualism and Language Development (BiLD) Lab](https://sites.psu.edu/bildlab/), where I primarily study the comprehension of dialectal variation and code-switching. I use neuropsychological (EEG) and behavioral methods to understand how cognitive, linguistic, and social factors interact during language processing.

I earned my MS in Psychology from Penn State in 2020 and my BA in Psychology, with a minor in Linguistics, from The University of Chicago in 2015. In between, I worked as a financial analyst supporting fair lending and language access initiatives at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/). For fun, I love to cook and bake, knit, and play with my greyhound, Zuko.
