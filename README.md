This website was created using a Github Pages template for academic websites. This was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License.

I customized several template features with lots of tips and code from [Rob Williams](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams)' [blog](https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/).
